## üîß Customization

To customize this portfolio for your own use:

2. Modify the `TechnicalSkills`, `ProfessionalExperience`, and `KeyProjects` components with your own details.
3. Replace the placeholder image in `AboutMe` with your own photo.
4. Adjust the color scheme in `index.css` to match your personal brand.

## üöÄ Deployment

This portfolio is set up for automatic deployment using GitHub Actions. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a build and deploy process to GitHub Pages.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file contains the workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: build
```

This workflow does the following:
1. Triggers on every push to the `main` branch
2. Sets up the project and installs dependencies
3. Builds the project
4. Deploys the built files to the `gh-pages` branch

To use this feature:
1. Ensure your repository is set up for GitHub Pages in the Settings tab.
2. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your updated site.

You can monitor the deployment process in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
